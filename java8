certainly! Java 8 introduced several powerful features that significantly enhanced the language. Letâ€™s explore some of the key features:

Lambda Expressions:
Lambda expressions allow you to write code in a functional style. They provide a concise way to implement Single Abstract Method (SAM) interfaces using expressions.
Useful for iterating, filtering, and extracting data from collections.

Method References:
A compact form of lambda expressions, method references allow you to refer to methods of functional interfaces directly.
Replaces lambda expressions when youâ€™re just referring to a method.

Functional Interfaces:
An interface with only one abstract method is known as a functional interface.
Can have default and static methods.
Also called Single Abstract Method (SAM) interfaces.

Optional Class:
Introduced to handle NullPointerException more effectively.
Helps check the presence of a value for a particular variable.

forEach() Method:
Available in Iterable and Stream interfaces.
Allows iteration over elements using a functional interface (you can pass a lambda expression).

Date/Time API:
Java 8 introduced a new Date and Time API (java.time package).
Provides better handling of date and time-related operations.

Default Methods:
Interfaces can now have default methods with method bodies.
Useful for adding new methods to existing interfaces without breaking implementations.

Nashorn JavaScript Engine:
Executes JavaScript code dynamically within the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
Useful for integrating JavaScript with Java applications.

These features have significantly improved Javaâ€™s expressiveness and productivity. Feel free to explore them further! ðŸ˜Š
